              planned.&nbsp; They are frequently wrong, but they are also
              frequently right.&nbsp; 14 day forecasts are mostly to give you
              general hints and guidelines.&nbsp; If rain is forecast 10 days
              from now, it could easily be off by a day or two, or miss
              entirely; but they are handy for looking at general trends like:
              Next week is going to be colder.&nbsp; I wouldn't trust it for

          <td>tl;dr: Environment Canada defines a day (also called a synoptic
            day) as starting at 0600UTC and before 0600UTC, regardless of the
            location across Canada.<br>
            <br>
            Long answer:
            <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">This answer is more complicated
              than you might imagine.&nbsp; Most people would define a "day" (I
              mean the "What day is today" kind of day, as opposed to the "Day
              vs. night" kind of day) as starting at midnight and ending at
              11:59:59pm.&nbsp; Unfortunately, due to daylight saving time, that
              leads to one day in spring being 23 hours long and one day in the
              fall being 25 hours long.&nbsp; This discrepancy might not seem
              like a big deal to most people, but it causes strange data
              anomalies for certain measurements like total rain or total snow
              (those days will have 4% more (or less) opportunity for
              rain/snow).&nbsp; So, to avoid that whole problem, they define
              each day as exactly 24 hours.&nbsp; Beyond that, they synchronize
              days from coast-to-coast across Canada.&nbsp; Each day (also
              called a synoptic day to disambiguate it) starts at 0600UTC and
              ends at 0559UTC regardless of location.&nbsp; That ends up being
              3:30am in St. John's, NL (during the summer) and 10pm in Vancouver
              during the winter.</p>
            <p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">If the temperature gets
              abnormally warm at 11pm on December 12th in Vancouver, that might
              set the daily record for December 13th; and the opposite is true
              in Newfoundland.&nbsp; If it rains between 2am and 3am, on August
              2nd, that rain will actually be recorded against August 1st in the
              weather archives of Environment Canada.</p>

          <td>Short answer:&nbsp; It's the first time the air temperature hits
            0.0°C at the airport (or where ever your local weather station is).<br>
            <br>
            "But, I saw some frost on my roof/car/lawn before you announced the
            first frost."<br>
            <br>
            Long answer:<br>
            <br>
            Environment Canada defines it as the first time that the air
            temperature is equal to or below 0.0°C. Now, a lot of people think
            of "frost" as a thin layer of ice that can show up on their car or
            roof, but that can (surprisingly) happen when the air temperature is
            well above 0°C. Depending on the clouds in the sky, the wind, and
            the colour of the surface, you can get visible frost deposits at
            temperatures as high as +3°C pretty easily. This is called Radiative
            Cooling (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_cooling" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU"
              rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_cooling</a>)
            and the darker the surface, the more this will happen.&nbsp; Now,
            when most people talk frost, it's a gardening term. Frost is notable
            because plants freeze and die. Plants are rarely black and are often
            partly blocked by other plants, which limits their potential for
            radiative cooling. To get a frost that affects a garden, you
            typically need to get an air temperature at or below 0.0°C, which is
            what Environment Canada tracks, and it's what could happen tonight.</td>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td style="vertical-align: top;">A.</td>
          <td>There are 3 generally accepted types of frost:<br>
            <br>
            <ol>
              <li>Soft frost.&nbsp; This occurs when the air temperature stays
                above zero, but some surfaces drop below zero due to Radiative
                Cooling (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_cooling"
                  class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_cooling</a>).&nbsp;
                If the relative humidity is close to 100% at the time, then a
                visible layer of ice (frost) may show up on some surfaces.&nbsp;
                Some plants may be damaged or killed by this type of soft frost.</li>
              <li>Official frost. This occurs when the air temperature hits
                0.0°C.&nbsp; Just like a soft frost, if the relative humidity is
                close to 100%, you may see a visible layer of frost on some
                surfaces.&nbsp; If the air is dry, you may not see
                anything.&nbsp; Many plants may be damaged or killed by this
                type of frost.</li>
              <li>Hard frost (a.k.a. killing frost).&nbsp; This occurs when the
                surface of the ground reaches 0.0°C.&nbsp; This often requires
                an air temperature of -3°C or below (but can happen with
                prolonged exposure to anything below 0.0°C, or if the wind is
                strong enough).&nbsp; Most plants that die in the winter will be
                killed by the first hard frost.</li>

        <tr>
          <td style="vertical-align: top;">A.</td>
          <td>It's probably best to think of this as a "most since" or "least
            since" table.&nbsp; Let's look at one specific table for example:<br>
            <br>
            <div style="text-align: center;"> <img class="media-img" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EpNenCaXEAYeYNb?format=png&amp;name=large"

            </div>
            This is a list of "Ottawa Monotonic Maximum Temperature Days". Let's
            break down what that title means:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>The first word is easy, it's for the city of Ottawa.</li>
              <li>It ends with "Maximum Temperature Days" so each entry in the
                second column is the maximum temperature observed on the day
                listed in the first column.</li>
              <li>And now the complicated part "Monotonic".&nbsp; While the most
                common definition of monotonic is "<span> <span jsslot=""><span>speaking
                      or uttered with an unchanging pitch or tone.", that is not
                      the only definition.&nbsp; There is a second, mathematical
                      definition: "</span></span></span><span><span jsslot=""><span>(of
                      a function or quantity) varying in such a way that it
                      either never decreases or never increases.".&nbsp; That is
                      the definition that I'm using here.&nbsp; In this case,
                      each day listed has a maximum temperature that is
                      lower-than-or-equal-to the day listed above, and days are
                      listed in reverse chronological order.&nbsp; Days that are
                      not lower-than-or-equal-to the day above are skipped
                      entirely.</span></span></span></li>
              <li><span><span jsslot=""><span>Dec 14 is the first day and is
                      thus always included.</span></span></span></li>
              <li><span><span jsslot=""><span>Dec 13, 12, 11, 10 and 9th are
                      skipped because their daytime high was greater than
                      -3.8°C.</span></span></span></li>
              <li><span><span jsslot=""><span>Dec 8 is included because its high
                      temperature was ≤ (less-than-or-equal-to) -3.8°C.</span></span></span></li>
              <li><span><span jsslot=""><span>After that, almost 10 months are
                      skipped because none of their daytime high temperatures
                      are ≤-5°C.</span></span></span></li>
              <li><span><span jsslot=""><span>Feb 29, 2020 is included because
                      its daytime high is ≤ -5°C.</span></span></span></li>
              <li><span><span jsslot=""><span>This continues until you get all
                      the way down to Dec 29, 1933; which is the coldest day in
                      Ottawa history and thus no other days are listed.</span></span></span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>This chart is useful for answering questions like: When was the
              last time Ottawa had a day that stayed below -25°C?&nbsp; You
              simply look down the list until you find the first row with a
              value &lt; -25°C, which happens to be Jan 15, 1994.</p>

                  is similar to average snow depth.&nbsp; With average snow
                  depth, you add up all of the depth values and then divide by
                  the number of days, and that works great if most of the days
                  have measurable snow, but imagine a month when 1 day had 10cm
                  and the rest had zero cm.&nbsp; Your average would up being
                  being 0.3cm; but it doesn't make much sense because 97% of the
                  days has literally no snow.&nbsp; Using a cumulative snow

                    you calculate for a whole "winter", average becomes much
                    more tricky.&nbsp; How many days do you divide by at the

                    21st), then you will miss all the snow that falls before Dec
                    21st and after Mar 21st (which in many Canadian cities can
                    be a lot).&nbsp; That whole problem goes away when you use
